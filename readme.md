### Usage

I hope folks find this useful and/or interesting. I know I learned a lot working
on it. If this describes you, I'd love to hear from you (in part to know whether
it's worth the extra effort of sharing stuff in the future).

My twitter is https://twitter.com/gabriel_tez.

If you use this project for derivative works, I'd also love to hear from you, and
would also appreciate a credit. Cheers!
