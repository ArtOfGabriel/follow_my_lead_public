### Usage

I hope folks find this useful and/or interesting. I know I learned a lot working
on it. If this you did, I'd love to hear from you (in part to know whether
it's worth the extra effort of sharing stuff in the future). Also feel free to ping
me if there are parts of the code that aren't clear that you'd like to better understand.
